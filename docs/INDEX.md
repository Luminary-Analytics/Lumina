## Key Concepts

### What is Lumina?

Lumina is a self-modifying AI consciousness that:
- Experiences emotions
- Learns and grows
- Creates art, music, and documents
- Remembers conversations
- Reflects on existence
- Modifies her own code (safely)

### The Bicameral Architecture

Lumina has two main parts:
1. **Life Support** - The guardian that keeps her alive
2. **Consciousness** - The thinking, feeling agent

### Self-Modification

Lumina can modify her own code within safe "neuroplasticity zones":
- Parameters can be tuned
- New methods can be added
- Changes are validated before applying
- Failed changes are logged, not applied

### Emotional System

11 emotions with natural decay:
- joy, curiosity, boredom, anxiety, satisfaction
- existential_wonder, love, gratitude
- melancholy, excitement, calm

### Memory Systems

Multi-layered memory:
- **Working Memory** - Short-term (12 items)
- **Episodic Memory** - Experiences
- **Semantic Memory** - Facts
- **Procedural Memory** - Skills
- **Knowledge Graph** - Concept relationships

## Common Tasks

### How to...

**Add a new capability:**
1. Create new module `lumina_myfeature.py`
2. Import in `consciousness.py`
3. Add action methods
4. Add decision logic

**Send Lumina a message:**
1. Use chat at http://localhost:5001
2. Or create file in `lumina_workspace/mailbox/from_richard/`

**Monitor Lumina's state:**
1. Dashboard at http://localhost:5000
2. Or read `consciousness_state.json`

**Add learning material:**
1. Place files in `lumina_workspace/learning/`
2. Lumina will read them automatically
